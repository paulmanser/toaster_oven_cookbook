Pizza Bagels
========================================================

A great recipe that allows for a lot of variation, so 
you're not just making the same thing over and over
again.  Requires few ingredients and is quick and
easy to make.  Much tastier than bagel bites!


### Ingredients
* 1 Bagel (I prefer Thomas everything bagels) 
* Pasta Sauce (try vodka sauce for a change of pace)
* Cheese (I use Sargento thin-sliced smoked provolone since it comes in round sandwich slices)
* Granulated garlic
* Dried basil
* Dried Oregano

**Optional**
* Fresh basil
* Pepperoni
* Diced onions
* Diced peppers
* Mushrooms
* Parmesan cheese
* etc...

### Directions

1. Line toaster oven sheet with tin foil and place bagel
halves rounded side down.  Spoon out some sauce and spread it
around.

2. Sprinke some granulated garlic on the sauce.

3. Punch a hole in the cheese to match the bagel, and put one
slice on each half.

4. Sprinkle oregano and basil onto the cheese.  Add other 
ingredients now as well.  (NB: If using fresh basil, add 
this later!)

5. Set toaster oven to 375 and bake for 10 minutes. If using
fresh basil, pull out the bagels and put it on with about 1 minute left.  Bagels should be crispy on the outside, soft on the inside,
and the cheese should be *slightly* browned
