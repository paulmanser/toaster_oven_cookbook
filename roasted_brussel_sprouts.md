Roasted Brussel Sprouts
========================================================

A very simple, but tasty recipe.  Short prep time, but
the sprouts take a while to cook in the toaster oven.
Sprouts should be slightly crispy/wilted/charred on the 
outside and mashed-potato-soft on the inside.  If you try
one and they aren't like this, throw them back in for 
another 10 minutes.

### Ingredients
* Bag of brussel sprouts (around 15 ct)
* Salt
* Pepper
* Good olive oil with some flavor

### Directions

1. Rinse and dry brussel sprouts.  Cut of the ends if
they are brown or gross looking.  Pull off any leaves
that look old/nasty.

2. In a bowl mix the sprouts with salt, pepper, and 
olive oil.  Roll them around in the bowl with your hands.
Salt and pepper should visibly coat the sprouts. Be 
generous with salt and pepper, as much of it will be
left behind in the bowl.

3. Line toaster oven tray with tin foil and dump out 
sprouts onto the tray.

4. Set toaster oven to 375 and roast for 40 minutes. Open
and shake tray every 10-15 minutes to move them around and
help them not to stick.

5. After 40 min, change toaster oven setting to broil and crank the 
temperature all the way up.  Leave in for another 5 minutes
or so until they look good and roasted (See original website). If you
burn the outside, you can just peel off the really bad leaves.
